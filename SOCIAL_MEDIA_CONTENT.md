### Technical Deep Dive
```
🛠️ Deep dive into Smart Alarm Clock's architecture:

**Challenge**: Create a reliable alarm system that works across different browsers and devices.

**Solution**: Multi-layered approach with graceful degradation:

1️⃣ **Core Engine**: TypeScript-based alarm logic with precise time matching
2️⃣ **Audio System**: Web Audio API with fallback to generated tones
3️⃣ **Notifications**: Browser API with Service Worker backup
4️⃣ **Storage**: localStorage with error recovery
5️⃣ **PWA**: Manifest + SW for native-like experience

**Key Learnings**:
• Browser permission handling is crucial
• Fallback strategies prevent feature failures
• TypeScript catches edge cases early
• User experience trumps technical complexity

The project showcases how modern web APIs can create desktop-quality applications.
